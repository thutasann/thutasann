## Hi I'm Thuta Sann ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a Web developer that loves building NEXT.JS, Angular/SpringBoot, and IOS Mobile apps. :globe_with_meridians:

I started my web development career with HTML, CSS and PHP. and After PHP, I've learnt Laravel web Framework.

After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using Bootstrap and Tailwind so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew Tailwind, you were cool. :alien:

But now, I've been coding in React.js, React Native, Next.js, Nest.js MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, PHP, programmings language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.

Now, I am currently exploring MERN Stack as Full Stack Development and ReactNative as Mobile App Development while Exploring deeply to NextJs.

I m now working as a Frontned Developer who is responsible for Website Development and PWA Development with ReactJS and NextJS at [Codigo - The Mobile App Company](https://www.codigo.co/).
