## Hi I am Thuta Sann ðŸ‘‹

### I'm a Web developer that loves building Angular, NEXTJS and WEB3.0 apps. :globe_with_meridians:

I've been developing websites since I was 18 years old. I started my web development career with HTML, CSS and PHP. and After PHP, I've learnt Laravel web Framework.

After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using Bootstrap and Tailwind so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew Tailwind, you were cool. :alien:

But now, I've been coding in React.js, React Native, Next.js Node.js, Angular.js, Solidity, Thirdweb, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, PHP, programmings language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.

I could improve my Frontend Development skills in Digital Laboratory Myanmar Company Ltd.

Now I m currently working as a Junior Developer who is responsible for building complex transactional Web-based applications with Angular.js and Spring boot (a little).
